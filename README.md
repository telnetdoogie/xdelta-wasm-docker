# xdelta-wasm-docker

This is a dockerized version of [@kotcrab](https://github.com/kotcrab/) 's [xdelta-wasm patcher](https://github.com/kotcrab/xdelta-wasm). 

Thanks to [@kotcrab](https://github.com/kotcrab/) for scrutinizing my approach in a very constructive way and helping me get this working!

Easiest way to use this is just to copy the `docker-compose.yml`, modify the port to your liking, and run it!
